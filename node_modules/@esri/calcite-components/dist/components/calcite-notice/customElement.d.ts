/**
 * Notices are intended to be used to present users with important-but-not-crucial contextual tips or copy. Because
 * notices are displayed inline, a common use case is displaying them on page-load to present users with short hints or contextual copy.
 * They are optionally closable - useful for keeping track of whether or not a user has closed the notice. You can also choose not
 * to display a notice on page load and set the "active" attribute as needed to contextually provide inline messaging to users.
 *
 * @slot [title] - A slot for adding the title.
 * @slot [message] - A slot for adding the message.
 * @slot [link] - A slot for adding a `calcite-action` to take, such as: "undo", "try again", "link to page", etc.
 * @slot [actions-end] - A slot for adding `calcite-action`s to the end of the component. It is recommended to use two or less actions.
